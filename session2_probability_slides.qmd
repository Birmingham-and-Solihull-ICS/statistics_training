## Introduction 

+ Commonly using statistics to infer things from data: known as ___statistical inference___
+ Built on ___probability theory___

## Terminology 

Main things to be aware of are:

* __Experiment / Trial / Event:__ The number of times something is conducted, e.g. a dice role or coin toss.
* __Outcome:__ The possible result we are interested in.  E.g. death, developing a disease
* __Exposure:__ Groups that are systematically different who's outcomes we might be interested in. E.g. treatment / control


## Activity:  Coin toss

In groups, or individually, toss a coin 20 times and note down how many 'heads' you get.

## Probability

Probability is a way of quantifying events, and how likely they are to happen, out of the available options.

+ __a-priori: __ where we know the probability (like a dice role)
+  __empirical: __ where we have to work it out through observation


We usually describe this as the number of times an event is likely to occur, out of the number of possible events.

:::{.column-page}
$$P(A) =  \frac{\text{Number of outcomes making up event (A)}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}$$
:::

## Example: coin toss

::: {.fragment}
If we consider flipping a fair coin:

$$P(heads) = \frac{(1 * heads)}{(1* heads) + (1 * tails)} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$
:::

## More examples: dice

If we consider a fair dice (die) roll, what is the probability of any given number, e.g. 6:

$$P(number) = \frac{(1 * number)}{\text{6 possible numbers}} = \frac{1}{6} = 0.16\dot{6}$$


## More example: deck of cards (1)

If we consider a red card in a deck of cards (no jokers):

$$P(\text{red card}) = \frac{(26 * \text{red cards})}{(26 * \text{red cards}) + (26 * \text{black cards})} = \frac{26}{56} = \frac{1}{2} =  0.5$$
<br><br>

## More example: deck of cards (2)

What would be the probability of drawing a queen in a full deck of cards (no jokers):


$$P(\text{queen}) = \frac{(4 * \text{queen})}{(52 * cards)} = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13} =  0.077$$

## Actvity:  Dice rolling

Roll 2 dice at least 24 times and note them down.  Write each possible number down: 1 - 12, and make a tally of each roll.
<br><br>
__What do you see?__

<br>
__How would you calculate the probability of rolling each number?__

<br>
__What is the probability of rolling any given number on each die?__

<br>


## Types of relationships within probablity

* ___Exclusivity:___ If we have more than one event, but one event prevents any other, we refer to it as exclusive 'exclusive'. E.g. a coin toss being 'heads' mean it is not 'tails'.

* ___Exhaustive:___ If we have accounted for all possible outcomes, we can consider the options 'exhausted.' E.g.  coin toss: probability of heads and probability of tails accounts for all options.


So the coin toss is ___mutually exclusive and exhaustive.___

### Exercises:

What are these two situations?  First try and answer the questions before looking up the answers on the tabs.

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Questions
1. Rolling a die and getting either an even number, or any number except 2.

2. Rolling a die and getting either an even number, or any number except 3.

### 1.

__Exhaustive,  not mutually exclusive__
Rolling a 4 or a 6 are both even, but the set contains all results.

### 2

__It's complicated__
Considering A & B, it's not exhaustive nor exclusive.  More like 'inclusive' (conditional?)
